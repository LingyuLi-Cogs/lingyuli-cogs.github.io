For my undergraduate, I majored in Clinical Medicine at [Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) School of Medicine, one of the best medical school in China, during which my academic interests shifted from our body to our mind. Since 2022, therefore, I began my Master's program in Psychiatry at [Shanghai Mental Health Center](https://chinaskinny.com/blog/brand-learnings-shanghai-mental-health-center) (widely known as 600, South Wanping Road, 宛平南路600号, among Chinese Internet). Deviating from the mainstream psychiatric research, I completed a surprising or even "weird" project - establishing computational models of [Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan)ian psychoanalytic theories on human mind, self-identification, and suicidal ideation using [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle). I love this project, full of intelligent satisfications, in an almost paranoid attitude. Luckily, after two years of 'rejections' and self-doubting, it gets recognition from peers and reviewers. One of them (now my friend) said it was a sexy work, which has been constantly encouraging me. The passion for understanding our mind never fading, I extended it to both biological and artificial mind. Currently, I am investigating the convergences and differences between humans and AI, seeeking implications for understanding human mind and advancing artificial mind, with my awesome collegues at [Safe and Trustworthy Center](https://ai45.shlab.org.cn), Shanghai AI Lab. I love doing research at the very intersection of AI, cognitive sciencen, and philosophy.
