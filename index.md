For my undergraduate, I majored in Clinical Medicine at [Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) School of Medicine, one of the best medical school in China, during which my academic interests shifted from our body to our mind. Since 2022, therefore, I began my Master's program in Psychiatry at [Shanghai Mental Health Center](https://chinaskinny.com/blog/brand-learnings-shanghai-mental-health-center) (widely known as 600, South Wanping Road, 宛平南路600号, among Chinese Internet). Deviating from the mainstream psychiatric research, I completed a surprising or even "weird" project - establishing computational models of [Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan)ian psychoanalytic theories on human mind, self-identification, and suicidal ideation using [Free Energy Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle). I love this project, full of intelligent satisfications, in an almost paranoid attitude. Luckily, after two years of 'rejections' and self-doubting, it gets recognition from peers and reviewers. One of them (now my friend) said it was a sexy work, which has been constantly encouraging me. The passion for understanding our mind never fading, I extended it to both biological and artificial mind. Currently, I am investigating the convergences and differences between humans and AI, seeeking implications for understanding human mind and advancing artificial mind, with my awesome collegues at [Safe and Trustworthy Center](https://ai45.shlab.org.cn), Shanghai AI Lab. I love doing research at the very intersection of AI, cognitive science, and philosophy.

Feel free to contact me regarding academic collaboration or opportunities to work with us at Shanghai AI Lab.
